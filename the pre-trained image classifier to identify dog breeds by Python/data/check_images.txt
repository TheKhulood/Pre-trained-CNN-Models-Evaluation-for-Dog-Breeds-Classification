4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
I will select VGG as the best model architecture. it classify the breed of dog correctly, the only arch that consider the Dog_02 as a dog and the only arch that consider Robot_01 as type of machine and finally consider Budgie_Bird_01 as bird. so it gets all the classification almost perfecrly.
